hours_studied = st.slider("📚 Hours Studied", 1, 12, 6)
previous_scores = st.slider("📝 Previous Scores (%)", 0, 100, 75)
sleep_hours = st.slider("😴 Sleep Hours", 4, 12, 7)
# ... and more
```

### Performance Analysis Visualizations

## 🎨 Design Decisions & Rationale

### Color Palette Choice
**Primary Colors:**
- Indigo (#6366f1) - Professional and trustworthy
- Purple (#8b5cf6) - Creative and modern
- Green (#10b981) - Success indicators
- Red (#ef4444) - Alert states

**Rationale:** Indigo/purple combination creates a modern, educational feel while maintaining professionalism suitable for academic institutions.

### Typography
- **Primary Font:** Outfit - Clean, modern sans-serif
- **Monospace Font:** JetBrains Mono - For numerical data display

**Rationale:** Outfit provides excellent readability for body text, while JetBrains Mono ensures clear distinction for data values.

### Layout Structure
- **Sidebar:** Compact input controls (left)
- **Main Area:** Four-tab analysis modules (center/right)
- **Fixed Footer:** Credits and information

**Rationale:** Standard web app layout pattern that users are familiar with, reducing cognitive load.

## 🚀 Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: Real-time Chart Updates
**Problem:** Charts weren't updating smoothly when users adjusted inputs
**Solution:** Implemented Streamlit's caching mechanism and optimized Plotly rendering

### Challenge 2: Performance Optimization
**Problem:** Initial load time was slow due to multiple visualizations
**Solution:** Used lazy loading for charts and cached model predictions

### Challenge 3: Responsive Design
**Problem:** UI broke on smaller screens
**Solution:** Implemented flexible layouts and responsive Plotly chart sizing

### Challenge 4: Cross-browser Compatibility
**Problem:** Different rendering in Chrome vs Firefox
**Solution:** Tested extensively and added browser-specific CSS fixes
